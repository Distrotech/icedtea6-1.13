New in release 1.7.1 (2010-02-26):

Bug fixes
- PR179: Rhino bootclasspath issue
- Add missing .c file to PulseAudio build
Zero/Shark
- Formatting changes and other fixes to match upstream
- PR428: Shark on ARM precompiled header incls
- Update Shark for LLVM r95390 API change.
- S6927165: Zero S/390 fixes (from upstream)
- Implemented Shark host CPU feature autotuner using LLVM 2.7 APIs.

- Strip stupid options that llvm-config supplies
- Update Shark for LLVM r94686 API change.

NPPlugin fixes
- PR446: Use JDK_UPDATE_VERSION to set the jpi version.
- Re-designed frame embedding code so that the applet is dynamically
  packed into given handle. This increases stability and breaks
  reliance on the assumption that the browser will always provide a
  handle in a certain sequence.
- Encode new lines, carriage returns, and other special characters
  before sending them to Java side (de-coding code is already in
  effect on Java side).
- Centralised and increased timeouts to give slow-loading applets
  enough time to load.
- Fix security permissions related to get/set property, based on
  specifications.

New in release 1.7 (2010-01-27):

- Updated to OpenJDK6 b17.
- Alpha version of the new IcedTea NPRuntime based plugin with support for 
  Firefox >= 3.5, Chromium, and other browsers that support NPRuntime 
  (use --enable-npplugin to build it).  For xulrunner >= 1.9.2 (used
  by Firefox >= 3.6), the new plugin is required and the build will
  automatically enable it if the old plugin is requested.
- Support added for building with HotSpot 16 using
  --with-hotspot-build=hs16.  This is the same as was released
  in the proprietary JDK6 update 18.
- Zero port updated to match the version submitted to OpenJDK
  as closely as possible.
- libjpeg7, libjpeg8, libpng 1.4 and libXext >= 1.1.0 supported.
- Added JNI call tracing using systemtap version 1.0+ when
  configuring with --enable-systemtap. See tapset/hotspot_jni.stp.

  pre-alpha technology preview and not recommended for use.
