Zero/Shark
- Formatting changes and other fixes to match upstream
- PR428: Shark on ARM precompiled header incls
- Update Shark for LLVM r95390 API change.

  packed into given handle. This increases stability and breaks
  reliance on the assumption that the browser will always provide a
  handle in a certain sequence.
- Encode new lines, carriage returns, and other special characters
  before sending them to Java side (de-coding code is already in
  effect on Java side).

  enough time to load.
- Fix security permissions related to get/set property, based on
  specifications.

  by Firefox >= 3.6), the new plugin is required and the build will
  automatically enable it if the old plugin is requested.
- Support added for building with HotSpot 16 using
  --with-hotspot-build=hs16.  This is the same as was released
  in the proprietary JDK6 update 18.
- Zero port updated to match the version submitted to OpenJDK
  as closely as possible.
- libjpeg7, libjpeg8, libpng 1.4 and libXext >= 1.1.0 supported.

  will drop support for the old version and only support HS14. Zero
  and Shark have been forward ported to HS14 (from HS12).

  remote X connection feels like it is all local. Build by default
  (disable with --disable-xrender). Runtime enabled by running java
  -Dsun.java2d.xrender=True (default is to use the old X renderer for now).

  test/jtreg-summary.log file with your distribution package so end users
  can compare the test results.
- Shark (--enable-shark) now builds on 64 bit platforms, but is a
  pre-alpha technology preview and not recommended for use.
- Better support for bootstrapping with different jar programs
  (supporting -J options).
- If --with-pkgversion isn't given the short mercurial rev node version
  will be used.  Package distributors are encouraged to build packages with
  --with-pkgversion to uniquely identify their distribution version number
  when java -version is run to help distribution specific bug reporting.

  to fix visual anomalies.
