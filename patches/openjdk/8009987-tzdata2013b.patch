+# From Paul Eggert (2013-03-06):
+# Morocco's daylight-saving transitions due to Ramadan seem to be
+# announced a bit in advance.  On 2012-07-11 the Moroccan government
+# announced that year's Ramadan daylight-saving transitions would be
+# 2012-07-20 and 2012-08-20; see
+# <http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=288>.
+#
+# To estimate what the Moroccan government will do in future years,
+# transition dates for 2013 through 2021 were determined by running
+# the following program under GNU Emacs 24.3:
+#
+# (let ((islamic-year 1434))
+#   (while (< islamic-year 1444)
+#     (let ((a
+#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute

+#     (setq islamic-year (+ 1 islamic-year))))
+#
+# with the results hand-edited for 2020-2022, when the normal spring-forward
+# date falls during the estimated Ramadan.
+#
+# From 2023 through 2038 Ramadan is not predicted to overlap with
+# daylight saving time.  Starting in 2039 there will be overlap again,
+# but 32-bit time_t values roll around in 2038 so for now do not worry
+# about dates after 2038.
